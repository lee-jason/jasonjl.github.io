Foreward: When I mention 'AI' in this article, I'm referencing the generative AI of today.

First off, big props to the real ones, the researchers. Everyone else is just benefiting / suffering from the trickle down effects of their monumental efforts. I am still so blown away at how the idea of expanded Attention truly blew the Markov Chain to something that would never pass the Turing test to something that can brew real romantic feelings from the user. I'm still very curious to know if the original researchers anticipated the emergent effects of preceived 'intelligence' from their initial hypothesis or whether they thought that their Attention model was just going to incrementally advance text generation. 

The conversation around AI is muddied by voices of all competing interests. The loudest stakeholders somehow seem to always be the CEOs of the leading AI companies themselves. The loudest dissenters are always the working people that AI would harm the most. The technological advancements of AI on its own are good enough to adopt as a tool through organic means, but the fact that the people with the largest stakes in AI succeeding are constantly yapping about its progress and its potential that it really feels like these billionaires are blatantly speedrunning the obsolescence of the average creator with the interest of adding a few more zeroes to their bank account.

It upsets me that the software engineering world took both the term and practice of 'vibe coding' and readily adopted it without thinking of the implications against their own job security. Consider that the term was coined by the ex-co-owner of OpenAI, a person with major interest stake in general AI taking off. Meta and Microsoft are now forcing their employees to use AI, it doesn't matter in what context, or what application. They too have a huge interest stake in the AI field taking off. I recognize that software engineers in this case don't have much choice to say no but by being complicit, they are actively reducing the availability of jobs for new hires and eventually for themselves. Software engineers could form a union but in this day and age, with the prevailing idea being that software engineering is a meritocracy, it is highly unlikely that engineers would ever stand in solidarity at least in this decade.

It dissapoints me that engineers are not more antagonistic against AI. It also dissapoints me that the profit motive forces engineers to use it to survive. If you want to stay at the top you would be best to adopt it. But the more we adopt it, the less workers we'll need. It is a cycle of job destruction, and the billionaires are speedrunning the course to its final end.
