At the end of my first startup, I was rolling out of bed each morning clocking in kind of a malaise. Days were usually spent running a meeting, aligning goals, working on a design, prototyping, reviewing, implementing... As I said in my previous memoir, I felt like I was forgotten. Work was predictable, comfortable, and I was enjoying the respect I had as a tenured employee and balance I had towards work and life. Despite the comfortable position I made for myself, I couldn't shake the idea that I should be doing something more challenging.

A friend called again to recruit me for his startup. It wasn't the first time, but this time it was the right time. I weighed the risk of jumping from a cushy job to something more unknown. Given how relatively young I am, I felt that I still have room for risk. I joined my second startup, a seed stage company as a founding engineer.

I anticipated the roles and responsibilities of a founding engineer would be vastly different from an early stage employee. The experiences I carried with me as an early stage employee at my first startup would not help me much here. I could not be complacent with the idea of just carrying my weight, but that of my team if needed. I felt that I was under a lot of pressure, but as they say, 'Something something, pressure creates diamonds...'.

Years of engineering baggage from my previous company was my inverse guiding star on how to build a better platform. One value my CTO and I were focused on was quickly building systems and patterns to not only make mistakes unlikely but impossible. We were only 6 months in into a fresh codebase and already had ~500 regression tests written for a huge swath of POC'd features. I experienced coding nirvana as I had full context and understanding of why decisions were made how systems interacted with each other and how I can tear it down and remake it if needed. This is the curse of being the first developer in that you have to construct everything from the ground up, but also the joy of being the first developer. The joy of having a command of an entire codebase or architecture is something I would encourage every developer to pursue and experience. The liberty of understanding acts as the engineering lubricant that allows you to pursue change with confidence where as the dirtied grease of ignorance is friction against finding the most ideal solutions. ..Does that analogy make sense?

New team members were brought on, constraints were being introduced which resulted in the slow complacent degredation of the code base. Small hacky allowances were made to meet a deadline. Deployment processes were side-stepped to reach the customer faster. You build your castle out of Legos and yet you find a load bearing Duplo block. This I saw as inevitable. I could only try to enforce patterns through education although I found that this didn't work very well for everyone.

We had an engineering team but we struggled to find a product to 'engineer'. It seemed for our space we were working backwards where we had the tools (AI.) and were trying to find a product around that instead of looking at the problem (job readiness) and solving for that. We tried a few ideas but they never took off. Whether its because we didn't give them enough time to bake, or if it was clear there was no impactful solution. Regardless of what it was, it seemed like we were grasping for straws. After all this, it became clearer to me that the problems that exist in post-college recruiting is a difficult problem to solve by some magical AI tool. 

Shortly after one year, I became redundant. The company didn't have a need for a large technical team for a product that didn't need a technical solution. I was given an offer to leave which I took.

# Afterwards

Working here transformed my understanding of work and motivation. There was about 3 months where I'd be on the laptop from 9AM to 11PM moving from task to task deploying at least 2 non-trivial feature prs and providing feedback for my team every day. Weekends are normal work hours from 10AM to 6PM. This is not an exaggeration. I'm incredulous myself to see this written down in ink but I have to iterate again, this is not an exaggeration. I felt possessed. I didn't feel fatigue, I didn't feel hunger. It was a fast acting loop of problem, solution, dopamine, problem, solution, dopamine. If I thought of something quick to implement late at night, I'd go for it. Problem, Solution, Dopamine. I wasn't motivated by the high of chasing the dopamine hit but rather by the chip on my shoulder. I still have something to prove. Given a new problem, can I solve it? If I seen the problem before, how fast can I solve it? How robust can I make it?

I'm incredibly proud of the high quality code base I left behind. The frameworks, the patterns, the components, I wish I could have taken with me. I gave a lot of love to the platform and it loved me back in return. It required me to be a dick sometimes but I hope my team understood why I demanded I was making these asks.

At this point in my life I'm just on the cusp of taking on another risk.
