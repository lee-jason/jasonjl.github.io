The final days of my first startup had me rolling out of bed each morning clocking in kind of a malaise. Days were usually spent running a meeting, aligning goals, working on a design, prototyping, reviewing, implementing, typical alignment and team synergy you know the deal... As I said in my previous memoir, I felt like I was forgotten. Work was predictable, comfortable, and I was enjoying the respect I had as a tenured employee and balance I had towards work and life. Despite the comfortable position I made for myself, I couldn't shake the idea that I should be doing something more challenging.

A friend called again to recruit me for his seed stage startup. It wasn't the first time he reached out, but this one time out of many I was finally in the right place and the right time. I weighed the risk of jumping from a cushy job to something that potentally had more opportunity. I mulled over that this may be my last chance to give it my all and try something risky. Recognizing the allure of opportunity and too afraid to miss out on it, I joined my second startup, a seed stage company as a founding engineer.

## Philosophy of a Founding Engineer

I anticipated the roles and responsibilities of a founding engineer would be much more involved than from an early stage employee. I knew the experiences I carried with me as an early stage employee at my first startup would not help me much here. I needed to quickly be comfortable with the idea that carrying my own weight is not enough. I would have to carry the weight of my team if needed. I felt that I was under a lot of pressure, but as they say, 'Something something, pressure creates diamonds...'.

Years of engineering baggage from my previous company greatly influenced the engineering philosophies I wanted to apply at my new job. There was a clear opportunity to heavily influence the engineering culture and I jumped on it. One value my CTO and I were focused on was quickly building systems and patterns to not only make mistakes unlikely but impossible. Along with all the typical systems needed to build a web app, we built systems around composable permissions, fail proof transactional emails, across the board api error messaging and logging, front-end resource caching... We were only 6 months in into a fresh codebase and already had ~500 regression tests written for a huge swath of POC'd features. 

I experienced coding nirvana as I had full context and understanding of why decisions were made how systems interacted with each other and how I can tear it down and remake it if needed. This is the curse of being the first developer in that you have to construct everything from the ground up, but also the joy of being the first developer. The joy of having a command of an entire codebase or architecture is something I would encourage every developer to pursue and experience. I now recognize the liberty of understanding the bigger picture which empowers you to make effective changes while ignorance instills fear and a tendency to apply bandaids parts are better off amputated.

New team members were brought on, constraints were being introduced which resulted in the slow complacent degredation of the code base. Small hacky allowances were made to meet a deadline. Deployment processes were side-stepped to reach the customer faster. You build your castle out of Legos and yet a few weeks later you find a load bearing Duplo block. This I saw as inevitable. Patterns and education can only work so far but true enforcement can only be applied through code.

## The Uphill Battle

We had an engineering team but we struggled to find a product to 'engineer'. It seemed that we were working backwards where we had the tools (AI.) and were trying to find a product, instead of looking at the problem (job readiness) and solving for that. We tried a few ideas but they never took off. Whether its because we didn't give them enough time to bake, or if it was clear there was no impactful solution. Regardless, we were grasping for straws. Day by day, it became clearer to me that the innocent mission statement of helping university students find jobs meant more than figuring out a product to get students to be job ready; It would mean that we would have to fight capitalism itself. 

Organizations today are using AI as an excuse to mask reduced quarterly profit, reduce hiring, and stifle wages. University students alongside the rest of the working class are feeling it the hardest. Now university students will have to compete against those who have been laid off by the very same system and reason of maximizing profits. Recent graduates have multiple hills to climb to even be noticed by an organization. Attempting to fulfil the mission of helping university students to find jobs using AI is a well intentioned but misguided attempt at a solution to the core problem.

Shortly after one year, I became redundant. The company didn't have a need for a large technical team for a product that didn't need a technical solution. I was given an offer to leave which I took.

# Afterwards

Working here transformed my understanding of work and motivation. There was about 3 months where I'd be on the laptop from 9AM to 11PM moving from task to task deploying at least 2 non-trivial feature prs and providing feedback for my team every day. Weekends are normal work hours from 10AM to 6PM. This is not an exaggeration. I'm incredulous myself to see this written down in ink but I have to iterate again, this is not an exaggeration. I felt possessed. I didn't feel fatigue, I didn't feel hunger. I felt numb in the same way you feel numb on a good run. It was a fast acting loop of problem, solution, dopamine, problem, solution, dopamine. If I thought of something quick to implement late at night, I'd go for it. Problem, Solution, Dopamine. I wasn't motivated by the high of chasing the dopamine hit but rather by the chip on my shoulder. Even today, I still have something to prove. 

I'm incredibly proud of the high quality code base I left behind. The frameworks, the patterns, the components, I wish I could have taken with me. I gave a lot of love to the platform and it loved me back in return. It required me to be a dick sometimes but I hope my team understood that I was only looking out for future us.

At this point in my life I'm just on the cusp of taking on another risk.
