Hi there!
Since it's quite a lot of work to write these summaries, I now try to write them during the course of the year.
You're looking at the unpublished draft of those summaries.

<h3 id="1-wild-chocolate">1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wild-Chocolate-Across-Americas-Search/dp/1639733574">Wild Chocolate</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/wild-chocolate.jpg" alt="Wild Chocolate cover" /></p>

<p>Even though cocoa beans originate from the rainforest in South and Central America, most of today’s cocoa production comes from West Africa, in particular from Ivory Coast and Ghana.
Most of the chocolate we eat is produced from these cocoa beans, which are usually fairly uniform in kind since people ended up cultivating the ones that are easiest to grow and harvest.
Using such uniformly grown cocoa beans unfortunately leads to less complex flavors in the final chocolate.</p>

<p>In <em>Wild Chocolate</em>, Rowan Jacobsen goes on a journey to find the last remains of wild chocolate in the rainforest.
Some specialty chocolate makers have made it their mission to seek out these wild cocoa trees with the goal of producing more rich and complex tasting chocolate.
However, finding such cocoa trees and harvesting the beans is not exactly easy, and can in all fairness be called an adventure.</p>

<p>I found the book to be super interesting. I enjoyed learning more about how chocolate is actually produced and it was fun to follow along on the search for wild chocolate. In particular since I started eating lots of dark chocolate, up to 100%, over the last year, it was cool to learn more about chocolate, and the book really made me want to try out some chocolate made from wild cocoa beans.</p>

<h3 id="2-lord-of-the-flies">2. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Flies-William-Golding/dp/0399501487">Lord of the Flies</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/lord-of-the-flies.jpg" alt="Lord of the Flies cover" /></p>

<p><em>Lord of the Flies</em> tells the fictional story of a group of kids and teenagers that survive a plane crash and end up stranded on a deserted island.
The kids realize that they need to organize themselves until eventual help, hopefully, arrives.
However, how exactly to do that is not entirely clear and different potential leaders and ways of running their mini society emerge.</p>

<p>I found the book to be absolutely brilliant.
On one hand, it is just genuinely interesting to read about what the kids do and what they will find on the island.
On the other hand, it was also really intriguing to see how the kids are trying to organize themselves and what the dynamics are like.</p>

<p>Besides just being interesting to read, I would also consider <em>Lord of the Flies</em> to be a really important book for people to read.
I can totally see why many schools in English-speaking countries cover the book in class, and why the author ended up winning a Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>

<h3 id="3-how-will-you-measure-your-life">3. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Will-Measure-Your-Life-ebook/dp/B006ID0CH4">How Will You Measure Your Life?</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/measure-your-life.jpg" alt="How Will You Measure Your Life? cover" /></p>

<p>Clayton Christensen was a professor at the Harvard Business School and is particularly well known for first describing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">inventor’s dilemma</a>.
In <em>How Will You Measure Your Life?</em>, Christensen talks about how to live a happy life that is filled with purpose.
To achieve that, he transfers over many business concepts and explains how to apply them in a personal context.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the book. It was super interesting to see how such seemingly business-focused concepts can also be applied to one’s personal life, and I also found Christensen’s life and his approach to things quite inspiring.</p>

<p>One idea that in particular stayed in my mind is carefully considering outsourcing. In the business world, there are of course well-known cases where outsourcing ended up badly, e.g. Western companies increasingly outsourcing manufacturing to Asian countries, and in the process forgetting, or not further developing, essential skills. However, the same concept can be applied to personal knowledge. For example, if a kid outsources various skills to you, that might be more efficient in the short term but has bad long-term consequences. Generally, you want to be mindful about outsourcing, and only do it for skills you definitely will not need in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="4-altered-traits">4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Altered-Traits-Science-Reveals-Meditation/dp/0399184392">Altered Traits</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/altered-traits.jpg" alt="Altered Traits cover" /></p>

<p>It is well known that meditation is a good practice for one’s mind.
But how long do the positive effects of meditation last? Just during the meditation itself or does meditation lead to changes that last a long time?
That’s exactly the question that <em>Altered Traits</em> discusses.</p>

<p>The book’s authors, Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson, have spent many decades scientifically studying meditation.
Their results show that meditation can indeed lead to altered <em>traits</em>, i.e. long-lasting effects, not just short-lived, altered <em>states</em>.
However, this is only the case when practicing regularly in certain ways.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the book. It was cool to learn about the positive effects of meditation and to see how they are actually being studied. I also really liked that the authors’ were quite honest about shortcomings of their own, initial studies. Meditation is indeed not easy to study scientifically, since it is non-trivial to guard against the placebo effect, but the authors found some good practices to deal with these issues.</p>

<h3 id="5-the-story-of-the-human-body">5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Story-Human-Body-Evolution-Disease/dp/030774180X">The Story of the Human Body</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/human-body.jpg" alt="The Story of the Human Body cover" /></p>

<p>Daniel Lieberman is professor for evolutionary biology at Harvard. In 2022, I had read his book <a href="https://jasonjl.me/#15-exercised">Exercised</a>, which I really enjoyed.
<em>The Story of the Human Body</em> is another book from Lieberman, covering how the human body evolved over time, and what consequences this has when it comes to health and diseases.</p>

<p>In the book, Lieberman postulates the concept of <em>mismatch diseases</em>, i.e. illnesses that occur because of a mismatch between what people’s bodies are evolved for in contrast to how people actually live today.
Type 2 diabetes is a typical example of such a mismatch disease. The human body evolved to crave sugar because it was incredibly hard to get for most of our evolution. However, today, sugar is abundant, and just listening to what we crave leads to a mismatch.
This concept not only applies to type 2 diabetes but to many other modern health issues as well.</p>

<p>I really liked the book. Lieberman is a great writer and has lots of interesting things to share.
However, it is worth noting that the book really spends most pages on <em>how</em> the human body evolved, and only a small part on what that implies for health and mismatch diseases today. Those topics are only covered in the last third of the book. That was a bit disappointing for me considering those topics were the reason I started reading the book.</p>

<h3 id="6-fortitude">6. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fortitude/dp/1847943675">Fortitude</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/fortitude.jpg" alt="Fortitude cover" /></p>

<p>In the modern day and age, you can often read that it is important to develop <em>resilience</em>, i.e. the ability to bounce back from difficult events and to grow with them.
In <em>Fortitude</em>, Bruce Daisley takes a closer look at what it actually means to be resilient and what the science says about resilience and experiencing difficult things.</p>

<p>Of course, it turns out that there are a lot of myths surrounding the topic. Not everyone that experiences traumatic events does develop resilience from them. And even the ones that do seem to exhibit resilience often struggle internally.</p>

<p>A set of studies that I found particularly noteworthy covered professional athletes. An astonishing number of elite athletes experienced traumatic childhood events and used sports as an outlet. Of course for every such athlete that suceeded in their sport, there are many traumatized kids that did not manage to find such an escape. And even for the elite athletes that did manage, a serious number of them still suffer from mental health issues today. So things are not all like they seem from the outside.</p>

<p>Besides these investigations, the author also shares some practical advice on what works, focusing on three particularly important aspects: having control and agency, being part of a community, and having a purpose. I found the advice to be sound, and all three dimensions really spoke to me. However, I also came away from the book a bit unsure; there is so much advice on resilience out there, as well as so much debunking of that advice.</p>

<h3 id="7-meditations">7. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meditations-Modern-English-Marcus-Aurelius-ebook/dp/B0DBJT81TR">Meditations</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/meditations.jpg" alt="Meditations cover" /></p>

<p>Marcus Aurelius was a Roman emperor about 2,000 years ago.
<em>Meditations</em> is his personal journal, consisting of life lessons and guidance that he learned during his life.
The book title should be read as “reflections” or “contemplation”, not as meditation as we understand it today.
It is also worth noting that the book was not meant to be published. Rather, it was written in the form of a personal journal.</p>

<p>I found it incredible how timeless some of the advice in the book was.
You can tell that Marcus Aurelius was an incredibly smart person and focused a lot on intellectual growth during his life.
However, some of the advice does not quite transfer to today’s world, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4861032-always-remember-what-heraclitus-said-the-death-of-earth-is">some</a> is really difficult to interpret in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is worth noting that there are many translations into English available. I opted for one into modern English, which significantly simplified reading the book.</p>

<h3 id="8-life-30">8. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-3-0-Being-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/1101946598">Life 3.0</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/life3.jpeg" alt="Life 3.0 cover" /></p>

<p>Max Tegmark is a professor of physics at MIT.
In <em>Life 3.0</em>, he talks about artificial intelligence; how it might happen and what the consequences for people are.
Nowadays, everyone is talking about AI, and it can be difficult to find actually novel thoughts on the topic, particularly for someone active in the field.
Life 3.0 managed to really positively surprise me in that regard. I got exposed to so many new ideas.</p>

<p>The book is incredibly well-written, with many intriguing ideas on how AI might develop, how to think about AI safety, and how we will actually want to live with AI in the future.
In particular, it was great how much the book made me reflect on things and what my preferred way of living with AI would actually be – it really is not that obvious.</p>

<p>I also thought it was super impressive that the book was written in 2017, just before the Transformer revolution started, at a time where models were still many orders of magnitude smaller, and web-scaling training was not yet commonly done.
Despite this, most of the book still reads incredibly well now in 2025. In fact, if I would have had to guess the publishing date, I would’ve guessed late 2022, and the only reason I wouldn’t pick a later date is that there are no ChatGPT references and the term large language model is not used.
The book really does transfer incredibly well to the AI space in 2025.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this book should be required reading for everyone working on AI.</p>

<h3 id="9-the-art-of-fermentation">9. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Fermentation-Depth-Exploration-Essential/dp/160358286X">The Art of Fermentation</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/art-of-fermentation.jpg" alt="The Art of Fermentation cover" /></p>

<p>Around 1.5 years ago, I got really into fermented food, and started regularly consuming kimchi.
Later on, I added kefir and other fermented food.
Besides having a ton of health benefits, as explained in <a href="https://jasonjl.me/##24-the-good-gut">The Good Gut</a>, fermented food is also just super tasy and can make dishes a lot more interesting.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to make fermented food myself, I read <em>The Art of Fermentation</em>.
The book starts by explaining the fundamental concepts, and then provides detailed explanations and recipes for pretty much every fermented dish on this planet.
Along the way, the author shares stories and letters that he received from readers. These were really fun to follow along.</p>

<p>When wanting to really learn well how to ferment food, this is the ideal book. Is it incredibly detailed and covers an enormous amount of different fermented foods. It is also well written and fun to read – though I would caution that it is a fairly long and detailed book, and thus takes quite a while to really go through.</p>

<p>Now, after having read the book, I regularly make my own kimchi, kefir and yoghurt, and really enjoy doing so.</p>

<h3 id="10-how-to-not-die-alone">10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Not-Die-Alone-Surprising/dp/1982120630">How to Not Die Alone</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/dont-die-alone.jpg" alt="How to Not Die Alone cover" /></p>

<p>Logan Ury, the book’s author, is the head of relationship science at the dating app Hinge.
Prior to that, she worked as a behavioral economist at Google and then as a dating coach.
In <em>How to Not Die Alone</em>, she explains how to date right, how to deal with break-ups, how to find lasting love and what makes relationships grow over time.
All of this is a mix of her own advice with what science, mostly psychology, has to say about these questions.</p>

<p>The book definitely has some great advice and I’m glad that I have read it.
However, I really dislike the title of the book. It sounds too hyperbolic and dramatic, whereas the book itself has a much calmer, positive vibe.</p>

<h2 id="books-in-german">Books in German</h2>

<h3 id="-das-kind-in-dir-muss-heimat-finden">??. <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Das-Kind-muss-Heimat-finden/dp/3424631078">Das Kind in dir muss Heimat finden</a></h3>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/books-2025/kind.jpg" alt="Das Kind in dir muss Heimat finden cover" /></p>

<p>Stefanie Stahl, the book’s author, is a psychologist.
In <em>Das Kind in dir muss Heimat finden</em>, she discusses how our childhood impacts our personality and beliefs.
These in turn impact how we behave as adults today and how we deal with relationships and conflicts.</p>

<p>The book provides lots of practical guidance on how to analyze the effects of our experiences, as well as some exercises for the reader.
I thought it was a really neat book with some great advice.</p>
