  spent a few wonderful months at Mozilla working on a

            What Is This?
            <h2>The this keyword in JavaScript is probably one of the most confusing and misunderstood fundamental concepts of the language. The use of this allows for repeatable creation of objects and flexibility in method sharing, but its often the source of many problems through misuse and misunderstanding.</h2>

            <h2>Object oriented Javascript isn't really a new concept. For years people have been trying to make JavaScript more familiar towards object oriented programmers by perverting its naturally prototypical architecture towards something more classical.</h2>
