# florian.github.io

- Static website generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)
- The theme is based on [estivo](https://github.com/fffabs/estivo) ([demo](https://jekyll-demos.github.io/estivo/))


## Installation

```sh
gem install jekyll jekyll-paginate
```

## Conventions

- All references are in ACM format
- Book covers in the "What I read" posts are scaled to a width of 300px

## Spell Checking

After [aspell](http://aspell.net) was installed, all `_posts` and `_drafts` can be spell-checked automatically:

```sh
make spellcheck
make s # as a shortcut
```

## Custom Includes

### Images

To add an image from the image asset folder of the current post, with a given caption:

```
{% include img.html url="x.png" description="caption" %}
```

Optionally, there's a `style` attribute for the caption and a `width` attribute for the image itself:

```
{% include img.html url="x.png" description="caption" style="margin-top:0" width="200px" %}
```

### Citations

The include system for citations is loosely based on LaTeX's system, as the two main includes are `ref` and `cite`.
The [Federated Learning](https://florian.github.io/federated-learning/#references) blog post shows how the final result can look like.

#### Adding a citation

```
{% include cite.html i=1 acm="LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y. and Hinton, G., 2015. Deep learning. nature, 521(7553), p.436." %}
```

The format has to be in the ACM (`acm`) citation style, as mentioned earlier.
The attribute `i` is the identifier for the citation and is used by the `ref` command to link to a citation.
It usually is a number, but does not have to be in theory.

It is possible to add more meta data to the citation, such as a PDF link:
```
{% include cite.html i=1 acm="TensorFlow: â€¦" pdf="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45166.pdf" %}
```

#### Referring to a citation

To link to the citation just created:

```
{% include ref.html i=1 %}
```

This automatically creates a link in the appropriate format and adds a tooltip.

#### Listing the citations at the end of a post

To list all citations, you want to capture them in a group and pass them to the `references-list` include.

```
{% capture references %}
	{% include cite.html i=1 h="Rojas, R., 2013. Neural networks: a systematic introduction. Springer Science & Business Media." %}
	{% include cite.html i=2 h="Riedmiller, M. and Braun, H., 1993. A direct adaptive method for faster backpropagation learning: The RPROP algorithm. In Neural Networks, 1993., IEEE International Conference on (pp. 586-591). IEEE." %}
{% endcapture %}
{% include references-list.html content=references %}
```

This typically only works well for citations with numeric identifiers.
However, the system should be easy to extend for other types, too.
